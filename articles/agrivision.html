    <!-- ABSTRACT -->
    <p class="article-abstract">
      AgriVision is an AI-powered computer vision system designed to detect crop stress,
      pest infestations, and plant diseases using agricultural images, drone footage,
      and live camera feeds. Built on the YOLOv8 object detection framework, the system
      addresses inefficiencies in traditional crop monitoring by enabling early,
      localized, and data-informed intervention. By shifting farmers from blanket
      chemical application to targeted treatment, AgriVision reduces operational costs,
      conserves resources, and improves yield resilience. The current implementation is
      deployed as a web-based prototype for validation, with an architecture designed
      to support offline and edge-based deployment in future iterations.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction: The Cost of Late Detection in Agriculture</h2>
    <p>
      Agriculture remains a critical pillar of food security and economic stability,
      yet crop losses caused by pests, diseases, and environmental stress continue to
      undermine productivity. In many cases, these losses are not the result of poor
      farming practices, but of late detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crop stress and infestations often begin subtly, spreading across fields long
      before visible symptoms appear. By the time damage is clearly observable,
      intervention options are limited and yield loss is already locked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      AgriVision was developed to address this visibility gap. It applies computer
      vision and artificial intelligence to provide farmers with early, precise
      insight into crop health conditions.
    </p>

    <div class="article-quote">
      Most agricultural losses occur before problems become obvious to the human eye.
    </div>

    <h2>The Traditional Farmer Approach to Crop Health</h2>
    <p>
      In many farming systems, crop health management follows a reactive and generalized
      approach. When disease, pest infestation, or stress is suspected, farmers often
      respond by purchasing pesticides, fungicides, or fertilizers and applying them
      across entire fields as a preventive measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach is driven by uncertainty. Without precise information about what
      the problem is or where it is located, farmers choose to treat everything to
      avoid risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      While understandable, this practice has several consequences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>High input costs due to excessive chemical use</li>
      <li>Unnecessary treatment of healthy crops</li>
      <li>Wasted time, labor, and resources</li>
      <li>Environmental and soil health degradation</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="article-highlight">
      <strong>Field Reality:</strong><br>
      Farmers often apply treatments broadly because they lack precise visibility into
      what is wrong and where it is happening.
    </div>

    <h2>The Core Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The central challenge is not willingness to act, but lack of actionable
      information. Traditional scouting methods are labor-intensive, inconsistent,
      and difficult to scale across large or remote farms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decisions are made reactively, based on visible damage rather than early signals,
      resulting in avoidable losses and inefficient use of resources.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution: AgriVision</h2>
    <p>
      AgriVision introduces AI-powered smart detection of crop stress, pests, and plant
      diseases. Using a YOLOv8-based computer vision model, the system analyzes images,
      drone footage, and live camera feeds to identify agricultural threats at early
      stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crucially, AgriVision does not just detect problems, it localizes them. Farmers
      are informed exactly what issue is present and where it is occurring within the
      field.
    </p>

    <h2>How AgriVision Changes the Decision Process</h2>
    <p>
      By replacing assumption-based treatment with evidence-driven insight, AgriVision
      enables targeted intervention. Farmers can focus resources only on affected
      areas rather than treating entire fields.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced chemical and input costs</li>
      <li>More efficient use of time and labor</li>
      <li>Earlier intervention and reduced yield loss</li>
      <li>Improved sustainability and environmental outcomes</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="article-quote">
      Precision turns uncertainty into informed action.
    </div>

    <h2>System Architecture and Model Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      AgriVision is built as a modular computer vision pipeline designed for flexibility
      and scalability.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> Images, drone footage, and live camera feeds</li>
      <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Frame extraction, resizing, and normalization</li>
      <li><strong>Detection Engine:</strong> YOLOv8 object detection model</li>
      <li><strong>Output:</strong> Bounding boxes and class labels highlighting affected areas</li>
      <li><strong>Decision Layer:</strong> Visual insights guiding targeted intervention</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Deployment Approach</h2>
    <p>
      The current AgriVision prototype is deployed as a web-based application.
      This deployment supports rapid testing, validation, and demonstration of system
      capabilities, and therefore requires internet connectivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the system architecture is designed to support local and offline
      deployment. Future implementations can embed the trained model directly within
      mobile or edge-based applications, allowing inference to run on-device without
      continuous internet access.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and Responsible Deployment</h2>
    <p>
      Responsible deployment of AgriVision focuses on accessibility, clarity, and
      farmer empowerment rather than technical complexity. While the current prototype
      relies on web-based infrastructure, future offline deployments reduce dependency
      on connectivity and high-end hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensuring transparent outputs, simple interfaces, and clear interpretation of
      detections remains central to adoption and trust.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion: From Reactive Farming to Intelligent Agriculture</h2>
    <p>
      Agriculture cannot remain reactive in an era of increasing climate pressure,
      rising input costs, and evolving pest and disease patterns. Early visibility and
      precision are no longer optional, they are essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      AgriVision demonstrates how applied computer vision can transform crop health
      management by detecting problems early and localizing intervention. By reducing
      guesswork and enabling targeted action, the system saves time, resources, and
      money while improving yield resilience.
    </p>
    <p>
      AgriVision represents a practical step toward intelligent agriculture, where data,
      technology, and farmer expertise work together to build more efficient,
      sustainable, and resilient food systems.
