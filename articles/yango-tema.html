    <h2>Background and Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Ride-hailing platforms operate as two-sided marketplaces where supply
      (drivers) and demand (riders) must remain in constant balance. When one side
      weakens, the entire ecosystem suffers. In Tema, Yango faced a prolonged
      decline in driver activity that had persisted for nearly three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      This decline resulted in long estimated time of arrivals (ETAs), reduced
      ride completion rates, and declining rider confidence. While new driver
      acquisition campaigns had been attempted in the past, they failed to
      address a deeper issue: a large pool of registered but inactive drivers who
      had disengaged from the platform.
    </p>

    <div class="article-quote">
      Data creates value only when insights are translated into action.
    </div>

    <h2>Understanding the Root Cause Through Data</h2>
    <p>
      Rather than treating the problem as a simple supply shortage, this project
      began with a data-driven diagnostic approach. Historical trip data, driver
      activity logs, and geographic demand patterns were analyzed to understand
      where and why the system was breaking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis revealed several critical insights:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>High-demand zones consistently lacked active drivers during peak hours</li>
      <li>A significant percentage of drivers were registered but inactive</li>
      <li>Long ETAs were discouraging riders, creating a negative feedback loop</li>
      <li>Previous activation efforts were poorly targeted and location-static</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="article-highlight">
      <strong>Key Insight:</strong><br>
      Demand was not absent — it was misaligned with driver availability.
    </div>

    <h2>Designing a Data-Guided Field Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      Based on these insights, the project shifted away from generic acquisition
      tactics toward a targeted, data-guided field strategy. The goal was not just
      to sign up drivers, but to reactivate dormant ones and restore confidence in
      the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers were segmented into active, semi-active, and inactive cohorts.
      Geographic heatmaps were used to identify under-served but high-demand
      locations, allowing the team to prioritize zones with the highest potential
      impact.
    </p>

    <h2>Execution: From Static Points to Mobile Operations</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most important execution decisions was replacing static
      registration tents with a fully mobile field operation. Instead of waiting
      for drivers to come to a fixed point, teams moved across identified
      hotspots—transport terminals, fuel stations, and high-traffic driver zones.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach reduced friction, increased visibility, and allowed for
      real-time engagement with drivers who had previously disengaged due to poor
      experiences or lack of trust.
    </p>

    <div class="article-highlight">
      <strong>Key Insight:</strong><br>
      Combining data analysis with field execution produced measurable improvements
      in driver engagement and ride completion rates.
    </div>

    <h2>Results and Measurable Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The intervention delivered clear operational improvements within a short
      timeframe. By aligning supply with demand and rebuilding driver trust, the
      marketplace began to stabilize.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased driver reactivation and onboarding rates</li>
      <li>Reduced ETAs in previously underserved zones</li>
      <li>Higher ride request acceptance and completion rates</li>
      <li>Improved rider satisfaction and platform reliability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      More importantly, the project demonstrated that sustainable growth requires
      more than dashboards—it requires execution informed by data.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
      This project reinforced several important lessons applicable beyond
      ride-hailing platforms:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data must inform decisions, not just report outcomes</li>
      <li>Field execution is most effective when guided by evidence</li>
      <li>Inactive users often represent untapped value</li>
      <li>Operational trust is as important as incentives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Reviving ride demand in Tema required more than new sign-ups—it required a
      strategic alignment of data analysis, business insight, and on-the-ground
      execution. This case study highlights how data-driven field strategies can
      transform struggling marketplaces into resilient, growth-ready systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      When data is treated as a decision-making asset rather than a reporting
      tool, it becomes a powerful catalyst for operational and business success.
