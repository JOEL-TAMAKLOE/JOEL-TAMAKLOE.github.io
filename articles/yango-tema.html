  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <p class="article-abstract">
    This article examines how a data-driven field strategy was used to revive ride demand
    in Tema after years of declining driver activity on Yango. By combining marketplace
    data analysis, fare experimentation, and on-the-ground execution, the project reveals
    how misaligned supply, inactive drivers, and pricing perception can quietly erode
    platform performance. The experience highlights why sustainable marketplace growth
    depends not only on dashboards, but on decisions informed by data and validated in the
    real world.
  </p>

  <div class="article-content">

    <h2>When a Marketplace Loses Its Balance</h2>
    <p>
      Ride-hailing platforms live and die by balance. When riders cannot find cars
      and drivers cannot find value, trust erodes on both sides of the marketplace.
      In Tema, Yango faced exactly this challenge. Driver activity had been steadily
      declining for nearly three years, quietly weakening the system long before it
      became visible to customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symptoms were clear. Longer estimated times of arrival, lower ride
      completion rates, and declining rider confidence. What was less obvious was
      the cause. Despite repeated driver acquisition campaigns, the problem
      persisted, suggesting that the issue ran deeper than simple supply shortages.
    </p>

    <div class="article-quote">
      Data creates value only when insights are translated into action.
    </div>

    <h2>Diagnosing the Problem Beyond the Obvious</h2>
    <p>
      Rather than treating the situation as a driver shortage, this project began
      with a diagnostic approach grounded in data. Historical trip data, driver
      activity logs, fare behavior, and geographic demand patterns were analyzed to
      understand where and why the system was breaking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several patterns emerged quickly:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>High-demand zones consistently lacked active drivers during peak hours</li>
      <li>A large percentage of registered drivers were inactive or semi-active</li>
      <li>Long ETAs discouraged riders, reinforcing a negative feedback loop</li>
      <li>Previous activation efforts were static and poorly targeted</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="article-highlight">
      <strong>Key Insight:</strong><br>
      Demand was not absent. It was misaligned with where and when drivers were available.
    </div>

    <p>
      This distinction was critical. The challenge was not attracting new drivers
      into the system, but understanding why existing drivers had disengaged and why
      supply consistently failed to appear where demand actually existed.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Data Could Not Fully Capture</h2>
    <p>
      While quantitative analysis revealed strong patterns, it also exposed an
      important limitation. Certain factors influencing driver behavior were not
      fully represented in reports alone. Fare perception was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through field engagement and direct driver conversations, it became clear
      that fare levels strongly influenced willingness to accept trips, especially
      in high-traffic zones where opportunity cost was high. Although the data
      showed declining activity, it did not directly encode how drivers felt about
      earnings relative to effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      By correlating fare structures with trip acceptance patterns and validating
      these insights through on-the-ground interactions, a data-informed decision
      was made to adjust fares strategically. When fares were reduced in a targeted
      and controlled manner, ride volume increased, acceptance rates improved, and
      overall marketplace liquidity strengthened.
    </p>

    <div class="article-highlight">
      <strong>Key Insight:</strong><br>
      Data guided the decision, but real-world dependencies completed the picture.
    </div>

    <h2>Designing a Data-Guided Field Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      Armed with these insights, the project shifted away from generic acquisition
      tactics toward a focused field strategy. The objective was not volume, but
      precision. Drivers were segmented into active, semi-active, and inactive
      cohorts, allowing interventions to be tailored rather than broadcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geographic heatmaps highlighted underserved yet high-demand locations,
      enabling teams to prioritize zones with the highest potential impact.
    </p>

    <h2>Execution: Mobility Over Static Operations</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most consequential decisions was replacing static registration
      tents with a mobile field operation. Teams moved through transport terminals,
      fuel stations, and high-traffic driver zones instead of waiting for drivers
      to come to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach reduced friction, increased visibility, and allowed for direct
      conversations with drivers who had previously disengaged due to poor
      experiences or eroding trust.
    </p>

    <div class="article-highlight">
      <strong>Key Insight:</strong><br>
      Data-driven execution is most powerful when it meets people where they already are.
    </div>

    <h2>Results and Measurable Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The intervention delivered measurable improvements within a short timeframe.
      By aligning supply with demand and rebuilding driver confidence, the
      marketplace began to stabilize.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher driver reactivation and onboarding rates</li>
      <li>Reduced ETAs in previously underserved zones</li>
      <li>Improved trip acceptance and completion rates</li>
      <li>Stronger rider confidence and platform reliability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      More importantly, the project demonstrated that sustainable growth requires
      more than dashboards. It requires decisions shaped by data and validated
      through execution.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data should guide decisions, not replace judgment</li>
      <li>Inactive users often represent hidden growth potential</li>
      <li>Field execution is strongest when informed by evidence</li>
      <li>Trust is as critical to marketplaces as incentives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Reviving ride demand in Tema was not about doing more. It was about doing
      differently. By combining data analysis, fare experimentation, field insight,
      and on-the-ground execution, this project transformed a long-standing
      marketplace imbalance into a growth-ready system.
    </p>
    <p>
      When data is treated as a decision-making compass rather than a reporting
      artifact, it stops describing the past and starts shaping the future.
