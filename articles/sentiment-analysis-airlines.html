  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <p class="article-abstract">
    Every airline hears from its customers. Few truly listen at scale. This article shows how sentiment
    analysis transforms thousands of raw airline reviews into clear signals about what customers love,
    what frustrates them, and where experience breaks down. Using a real-world analysis of British Airways
    reviews, it demonstrates how unstructured text can become a strategic asset for customer experience
    decision-making.
  </p>

  <div class="article-content">

    <h2>When Customer Feedback Becomes a Blind Spot</h2>
    <p>
      Airlines generate enormous volumes of customer feedback across booking platforms, airline websites,
      and independent review forums. Buried in these reviews are insights about service quality, staff
      performance, delays, communication gaps, and customer trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is not a lack of feedback. It is scale. Reading and interpreting thousands of free-text
      reviews manually is slow, subjective, and impossible to sustain. As a result, many organizations
      rely on summaries, surveys, or isolated complaints, leaving valuable signals unnoticed.
    </p>

    <div class="article-quote">
      Customer sentiment does not disappear when ignored. It compounds.
    </div>

    <h2>Why Sentiment Analysis Matters in Aviation</h2>
    <p>
      In aviation, customer experience directly affects brand loyalty, repeat bookings, and public
      perception. Delays, baggage handling, staff behavior, and communication during disruptions all shape
      how customers judge an airline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentiment analysis offers a way to continuously monitor how customers feel, not just what they say.
      By quantifying emotion across large datasets, airlines can move from reactive reputation management
      to proactive experience improvement.
    </p>

    <div class="article-highlight">
      <strong>Key Idea:</strong><br>
      Sentiment analysis turns emotion into data that leaders can act on.
    </div>

    <h2>Project Overview: Analyzing British Airways Reviews</h2>
    <p>
      This project applied sentiment analysis to publicly available British Airways customer reviews.
      The objective was simple but powerful: understand how customers actually experience the airline,
      using their own words, at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      British Airways was chosen due to the volume and diversity of online reviews, making it an ideal
      case study for exploring how customer sentiment aligns with operational realities.
    </p>

    <h2>Collecting Real Customer Voices Through Web Scraping</h2>
    <p>
      Reviews were collected using web scraping techniques from publicly accessible review platforms.
      Automated scripts extracted review text, ratings, and relevant metadata, producing a dataset
      containing thousands of authentic customer opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach ensured the analysis reflected real customer experiences rather than curated or
      survey-based responses.
    </p>

    <h2>Cleaning Language Before Teaching Machines</h2>
    <p>
      Raw customer reviews are messy. They include emojis, informal language, inconsistent formatting,
      and strong emotional expressions. Before modeling, the text was cleaned and prepared using standard
      NLP preprocessing techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and tokenization helped reduce noise while
      preserving meaningful linguistic patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Teaching Models to Read Between the Lines</h2>
    <p>
      A supervised machine learning approach was used to classify reviews into sentiment categories such
      as positive, neutral, and negative. This allowed the system to handle nuance and variability far
      better than simple rule-based methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond labeling sentiment, the goal was to surface patterns. What issues repeatedly triggered
      negative sentiment? What experiences consistently drove positive reactions?
    </p>

    <div class="article-highlight">
      <strong>Key Insight:</strong><br>
      Repeated sentiment patterns often signal structural issues, not isolated complaints.
    </div>

    <h2>What the Data Revealed</h2>
    <p>
      The sentiment analysis uncovered several recurring themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Negative sentiment frequently clustered around delays and poor communication</li>
      <li>Staff professionalism and in-flight service strongly influenced positive sentiment</li>
      <li>Recurring complaints pointed to systemic pain points rather than one-off incidents</li>
      <li>Neutral sentiment often masked low-level dissatisfaction that could escalate over time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>From Insight to Action</h2>
    <p>
      These findings can directly inform airline decision-making. Communication strategies during delays
      can be improved, staff training programs refined, and persistent service gaps prioritized based on
      customer impact rather than assumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When sentiment data is aligned with operational metrics, airlines gain a clearer view of where
      experience truly breaks down.
    </p>

    <h2>Limits of Sentiment and What Comes Next</h2>
    <p>
      Sentiment analysis is powerful but imperfect. Sarcasm, mixed emotions, and cultural language
      nuances can challenge models. Sentiment alone also cannot fully explain why customers feel a
      certain way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future enhancements could include aspect-based sentiment analysis, topic modeling, real-time
      dashboards, and integration with operational performance data.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can transform unstructured customer feedback into
      operational intelligence. By listening to customers at scale, airlines can detect problems earlier,
      prioritize fixes more effectively, and design experiences that build trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an industry where perception shapes loyalty, the airlines that win will not be the ones with
      the most data, but the ones that understand how their customers feel and act on it.
    </p>
