    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Airlines receive thousands, sometimes millions, of customer reviews across booking platforms,
      airline websites, and independent review forums. These reviews contain valuable insights about
      service quality, customer satisfaction, and operational challenges. However, manually reading
      and interpreting this volume of unstructured text is inefficient, subjective, and nearly
      impossible at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where <strong>sentiment analysis</strong> becomes a powerful tool. By combining web
      scraping, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP), airlines can automatically
      analyze customer feedback, detect recurring issues, and transform raw text into actionable
      insights. This article explores how sentiment analysis was applied to British Airways customer
      reviews and how the resulting insights can support better customer experience decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>The Business Context: Why Customer Sentiment Matters in Aviation</h2>
    <p>
      Customer experience is a critical competitive advantage in the airline industry. Factors such
      as flight delays, staff behavior, communication quality, and baggage handling strongly influence
      customer loyalty and brand perception. When negative experiences occur repeatedly across many
      customers, they can significantly impact reputation and revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional approaches to understanding customer feedback often rely on surveys or manual
      summaries. While useful, these methods lack scale and speed. Sentiment analysis enables airlines
      to continuously monitor customer perception, identify pain points early, and prioritize
      improvements based on real customer feedback rather than assumptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection Through Web Scraping</h2>
    <p>
      To build the dataset for this project, customer reviews were collected using
      <strong>web scraping techniques</strong> from publicly available British Airways review pages.
      Automated scripts were used to extract review text, ratings, and relevant metadata directly
      from the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web scraping enabled the collection of a large and diverse set of real customer opinions that
      would otherwise be time-consuming to gather manually. The resulting dataset contained
      thousands of reviews written in natural, unstructured language, closely reflecting authentic
      customer experiences.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Cleaning and NLP Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>
      As with most scraped text data, the raw reviews contained noise such as inconsistent formatting,
      special characters, emojis, and informal language. Before modeling, the text was cleaned and
      prepared using standard NLP preprocessing techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      These steps included converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and numbers,
      eliminating stopwords, and tokenizing text into individual words. This preprocessing ensured
      that the machine learning models focused on meaningful linguistic patterns rather than
      irrelevant artifacts.
    </p>

    <h2>Modeling Approach: Applying Machine Learning for Sentiment Classification</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of rule-based sentiment detection, a machine learning approach was adopted to handle
      the complexity and variability of human language. Supervised learning models were trained to
      classify customer reviews into sentiment categories such as positive, neutral, and negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feature extraction techniques transformed the text into numerical representations suitable for
      modeling. The objective was not only to label sentiment, but also to uncover recurring themes
      within customer feedback—highlighting what customers praise most and what issues consistently
      generate dissatisfaction.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Insights and Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Several meaningful patterns emerged from the sentiment analysis:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Negative sentiment frequently clustered around flight delays and poor communication</li>
      <li>Staff behavior and in-flight service were strong drivers of positive sentiment</li>
      <li>Repeated complaints pointed to systemic issues rather than isolated incidents</li>
      <li>Neutral sentiment often masked mild dissatisfaction that could escalate if ignored</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These insights demonstrate how sentiment analysis helps organizations move beyond anecdotal
      feedback and toward data-driven prioritization of customer experience challenges.
    </p>

    <h2>Translating Insights into Business Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The real value of sentiment analysis lies in how insights are applied. Airlines can leverage
      sentiment findings to improve communication strategies during delays, design targeted staff
      training programs, and identify underperforming services early.
    </p>
    <p>
      By aligning customer sentiment data with operational decisions, airlines can proactively
      enhance customer experience rather than reacting only after reputational damage has already
      occurred.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations and Future Improvements</h2>
    <p>
      While sentiment analysis is powerful, it has limitations. Models may struggle with sarcasm,
      mixed emotions within a single review, or cultural nuances in language. Additionally, sentiment
      alone does not fully capture the context behind customer dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future enhancements could include aspect-based sentiment analysis, topic modeling for deeper
      insight discovery, real-time sentiment monitoring dashboards, and integration with operational
      performance metrics.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      By combining web scraping, machine learning, and natural language processing, this project
      demonstrates how unstructured customer reviews can be transformed into actionable insights.
      The British Airways sentiment analysis highlights the power of data-driven approaches in
      improving customer experience and guiding strategic decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an industry where customer perception directly impacts loyalty and revenue, leveraging
      sentiment analysis is no longer optional—it is essential for building scalable,
      customer-centric airline operations.
